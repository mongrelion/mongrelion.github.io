      <description>If you have two files in Go that look like this:
a.go
package main func main() { println(foo()) }  b.go
func foo() string { return &amp;quot;Hello, foo!&amp;quot; }  If you go build . the project, it completes without errors and the binary file is generated:
$ ls -l a.go b.go foo  And it works:
$ ./foo Hello, foo!  But when you&amp;rsquo;re developing you want to run the project right from Go instead of compiling and then running the binary.</description>

      <title>AngularJS, Sinatra and HTML5Mode</title>
      <link>https://carlosleon.info/blog/angular-sinatra-html5mode/</link>

      <description>Sinatra, AngularJS and HTML5Mode The Sinatra Part get &amp;quot;/*&amp;quot; do File.read(File.join(&amp;quot;public&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;index.html&amp;quot;)) end  Put this at the bottom of your application file and this will serve your AngularJS application at any endpoint. This, of course, will read the public/index.html file every time that you head that endpoint. Better if you memoize it.
get &amp;quot;/*&amp;quot; do render_index end def render_index @index ||= File.read(File.join(&amp;quot;public&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;index.html&amp;quot;)) end  Important note Any other route that you register after this snippet won&amp;rsquo;t be triggered as &amp;quot;/*&amp;quot; matches everything.</description>

      <title>Cookies with cURL</title>

      <description>If want to consume an API that uses sessions using cURL, then probably you will need to make use of cookies. Using cookies with cURL is pretty simple.
I&amp;rsquo;m going to create a simple web application using [Sinatra] for the example&amp;rsquo;s sake:
require &amp;quot;rubygems&amp;quot; require &amp;quot;sinatra&amp;quot; enable :sessions get &amp;quot;/&amp;quot; do session[:user] # Return whatever stored in session[:user]. end post &amp;quot;/&amp;quot; do session[:user] = params[:user] # Set session[:user] to whatever sent on param.</description>

      <title>Generating JSON in Go</title>

      <description>Say you have a custom type defined like this:
type User struct { id int email string age int married bool }  Using the encoding/json package from the standard library to serialise an instance of a User would look something like this:
package main import ( &amp;quot;encoding/json&amp;quot; &amp;quot;fmt&amp;quot; ) func main() { u := User{1, &amp;quot;john@doe.com&amp;quot;, 33, true} uJSON, err := json.Marshal(u) if err != nil { fmt.Printf(&amp;quot;Something went wrong: %s\n&amp;quot;, err) } else { fmt.</description>

      <title>Javascript events pool</title>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve lately worked with mainstream SPA frameworks (Angularjs, Emberjs, Backbonejs) and related, you should know by now that things are kept in sync thanks to data binding.
It&amp;rsquo;s a pleasure because (with some luck) you just need to setup your bindings and views and data models would automatically be kept in sync.
Now, if you are working with a simpler application (that may not require any framework) but you would like to have some binding still you don&amp;rsquo;t want to load any framework to your project just because you want some binding here and maybe there.</description>

      <title>Improving (?) my site&#39;s performance: Part II</title>
      <link>https://carlosleon.info/blog/improving-my-sites-performance-part-2/</link>

      <description>A couple of weeks ago I decided to internally improve my website. Here I explain exactly what is it that I did to do so. Some of these changes include ruby memoize/memoization and Sinatra Caching.
As I previously mentioned, my blog&amp;rsquo;s architechture is inspired in [@cyx]&amp;rsquo;s personal website. However, I was not totally comfortable with the fact that everytime that a page was requested (a blog post in this case), the application had to go to disk, bring the blgo post, parse the markdown and then render the view.</description>

      <description>When I decided to finally come up with a blog, I gave Jekyll and Octopress a try. Nice plugins, &amp;ldquo;easy&amp;rdquo; deployment strategies and what not, but somehow I could not cope with them. That&amp;rsquo;s why I decided to write my own. At last I am a software developer and building a semi-static website shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be that complicated.
The solution I came up with is inspired by @cyx&amp;rsquo;s personal website, although now I seriously am thinking about refactoring a couple stuff here and there.</description>

      <title>Backbone.js best practices for n00bs</title>

      <guid>https://carlosleon.info/blog/backbone-js-best-practices-for-n00bs/</guid>
      <description>The other day I was looking for some Backbone.js tutorials on the internetz, something that could give me some clue about how to properly structure a web application using this framework and I found a not that old (one year and a half now) blog post talking about how to do a trivial Backbone.js application. A professor at college told me once that the best way to learn to write good code is reading good code.</description>

      <title>Method stub with MiniTest</title>

      <description>MiniTest is a testing tool that provides the necessary resources to make your test suite a complete stack, supporting TDD, BDD, mocking and benchmarking. It comes by default with Ruby 1.9.x and is also available for Ruby 1.8.7.
It provides two styles of testing: Unit tests and Specs. I personally prefer Specs since they are easier to read. Find out more about this on the documentation site. If you&amp;rsquo;re not yet using it, I suggest you to give it a try.</description>
